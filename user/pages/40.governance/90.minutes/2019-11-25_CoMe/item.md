<!--
Hello facilitator/notary! Thank you for your services. Here is some advice for facilitating coordination meetings:
  - Prepare the meeting a bit beforehand (find out about evaluations, gas, electricity and water usages, waste collections, income, scheduled events). You can ask others to assist you.
  - Notify people 10 minutes before the meeting starts. (Watching the clock is not super fun, people will be grateful if you do it for them.)
  - Start at 10:00 sharp, or earlier if everyone is there. (Waiting is time-wasting, be a time-saver!)
  - If you don't want to take notes yourself ask someone else to take care of that. (This pad can easily be used to read from and write in simultaneously.)
  - Go through the ordered points in order, even if nothing has changed. (They are arranged to try and get the most relevant information to most people.)
  - Feel welcome to moderate conversation if off-topic or too detailed. (Are listeners interested? Are speakers satisfied? Can you identify a sub-group?)
  - Try to finish the meeting before 11:00. (There is always more to talk about and it's important for people to know that CoMes don't take forever.)
  - Leave the room once the meeting has ended. (This sends a clear signal to everyone else that they can also leave and get on with their day.)
  - Take care that the meeting minutes will be put to kanthaus.online. (If you don't know how to do it, ask someone to help you with it. But do it today!)
  - As soon as the minutes are online, empty the pad from all irrelevant things and get it ready for the next facilitator. (Only keep regular events such as CoMe, power hour, regular food pickups and such. Move the counter figures from 'last 7 days' to '7 days before that' and adjust the date to next week.)
  - Have fun!

### 6. Discussion (e.g. questions, proposals, updates, requests, etc.)

- [michal] Daniel and Tom from Bennewitz who are interested in organizations working for change around Wurzen visited briefly on Friday. They would like to learn more about Kanthaus, preferably in German. Some additional info on Slack.
    - we may call them
    - they may come to Open Tuesday to talk
- [doug] Proposal to amend constitution to consider people <15 as dependents of their parents/carers until they ask to be considered as independent people. They would not have a position and would not be directly evaluated: https://github.com/kanthaus/kanthaus.online/compare/const_dependents_doug_2019-11-23?expand=1
- [doug] Calendar sharing with VK. Sadly nextcloud permissioning is... complicated. Additionally, I don't know if they have CalDAV technology in use. There seem to be multiple Telegram bots to do this, but I don't know how to set up :/ https://github.com/Skyy93/icalBot_Telegram
    - we are a bit confused about what doug means. Matthias and Doug will discuss further when Doug is back.
    - maybe just use a public calendar?
- [tilmann] intermediate storage room "flushing" action this week?
    - will be Wednesday 10:00, Tilmann will coordinate
    - if you have something in the intermediate storage room that you want to keep, talk to Tilmann
- [janina] There should be no stuff in the K22 ground floor during Open Tuesday. Can we agree to not put anything there on Tuesdays?
    - yes!
- [thore] FFF meetings on Sunday: who feels responsible?
    - [janina] maybe we add this to the upcoming section and define a responsible person every week to make sure the door gets opened?
    - [matthias] I normally feel responsible for coordination, was there an actual problem?
    - solution: we define one responsible person at come. This person is aware that the FFF people come and opens the door for the first person arrving. They are then responsable themselves for opening the door to the other people arriving.
- [janina] 'Product recommendations' in CoMe? Background: Making sure that food gets eaten. Method: Have a person recommend a product to be prepared this week. Potentially in a funny way, as if they tried to sell it... ;) We could give out the task of choosing the product in CoMe for the following week.
- [lise] what about the idea of giving a money expenses overview in CoMe and ask if somebody wants to go shopping the next week?
    - retrospective (what was spent)
    - plans (what will be spent)
    - we have a new section in CoMe
    - affects KH money only
- [findus] we should coordinate with sven from grimmaer tafel to keep good contact
    - 2 boxes (1 good, 1 crappy one) to give back, but Sven doesn't reply
    - findus may call again?
- [lise?] https://cloud.kanthaus.online/apps/files/?dir=/Kanthaus&fileid=150 Advent is coming soooooon
- [nick] bike related project work whilst I'm here?
    - meeting about parts shopping/looking through the bikes again later
- [findus] damian who stays until monday after the WE might need a host [max will do]
- [Lise] Couch pick-up today 15:30 in wurzen, who can do that / help lise? [Nathalie, Lise, Julia, michal]
- [Bodhi] court-training to happen 13.-15.12.
- [findus] can I take a ticket from tomorrow until dec. 4th?
    - approved
- [Bodhi] wuppweek to happen 13.-19.01. (B. had a call with chandi)
    - Chandi and Bodhi will take care of inviting, organizing, etc.
- [Matthias] somebody up for helping ~1 hour carrying gravel out of the electronics workshop today?
    - Julia will help
